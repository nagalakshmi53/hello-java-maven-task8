# Task 8 - Jenkins + Maven Build (Simulated)

This is a basic Java Hello World project built using Maven in a Jenkins freestyle job.

## Files
- `HelloWorld.java` - Simple Java program

## Notes
Due to environment constraints, Maven and Jenkins setup was not executed live. Output is based on standard Maven build output for a basic project.
